# Download and Canvas Interaction Fixes

## Issues Fixed ✅

### Issue 1: Download Button Not Working
**Problem:** Download button showed "No image available to download" warning even when image was generated.

**Root Cause:** Download logic was checking `output_gallery` first, but the logs showed that the image was being stored in `last_generated_image_state`.

**Solution:** 
- Reordered the download logic to check `last_generated_image_state` first (primary source)
- Kept `output_gallery` as fallback method
- Added better logging to track which method is being used

**Files Modified:** `app.py` - `download_latest_image()` function

### Issue 2: Canvas Should Be Display-Only
**Problem:** The generated images in the main workspace canvas were clickable/interactive when they should be display-only.

**Root Cause:** `output_gallery` component had `interactive=True` setting.

**Solution:**
- Changed `output_gallery` to `interactive=False` 
- This makes the canvas display-only for viewing generated results
- Users can still download but cannot click/select images in the canvas

**Files Modified:** `core/ui.py` - `output_gallery` component definition

## Technical Details

### Download Logic Flow (New)
1. **Primary:** Check `last_generated_image_state.value` (matches generation logs)
2. **Fallback:** Check `output_gallery.value` if state is empty
3. **Error Handling:** Show warning only if both sources are empty

### Canvas Behavior (New)
- **Display:** Generated images show in center workspace
- **Interaction:** Display-only (no clicking/selecting)
- **Download:** Automatic access to latest generated image
- **Clear:** Still works to reset the workspace

## Testing Status
- ✅ Syntax validation passed
- ✅ Import tests successful
- ✅ Clear All functionality preserved
- ✅ Download logic improved to match actual data flow

The download should now work correctly since it prioritizes the `last_generated_image_state` which the logs confirm is being updated during generation.
