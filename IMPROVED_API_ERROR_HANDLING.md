# Improved API Error Handling

## Problem Resolved ✅

**Issue:** 504 Gateway Timeout errors from GRS AI API were showing generic error messages, not providing clear guidance to users.

**Error Details:**
- `requests.exceptions.HTTPError: 504 Server Error: Gateway Time-out`
- Generic error message: "API Request Error: 504 Server Error..."
- No guidance on what users should do

## Enhanced Error Handling Implemented

### 1. Specific Timeout Handling
**Before:** Generic "API Request Error"
**After:** Clear, actionable error messages:

- **⏰ Request Timeout**: "The server is taking too long to respond. Please try again in a moment, or consider switching to a different model provider."
- **🚪 Gateway Timeout (504)**: "The API server is currently overloaded or temporarily unavailable. Please try again in a few minutes, or switch to 'Pro (Black Forest Labs)' model."

### 2. Comprehensive HTTP Error Codes
Added specific handling for common API issues:

- **🔧 503 Service Unavailable**: Server maintenance message
- **⚡ 429 Rate Limited**: Too many requests guidance
- **🌐 Connection Error**: Network connectivity issues
- **❌ Generic HTTP Errors**: Fallback with status codes

### 3. Improved Polling Error Handling
**Polling Loop Enhancements:**
- Retry on temporary network issues
- Only fail after multiple consecutive errors
- Clear timeout messages after 2 minutes
- Graceful degradation for intermittent connectivity

### 4. User-Friendly Error Messages
**Key Improvements:**
- **Clear icons** (⏰🚪🔧⚡🌐) for easy recognition
- **Actionable advice** (switch providers, wait, check connection)
- **Alternative solutions** (suggest other model providers)
- **Technical details** available in logs for debugging

## Error Message Examples

### 504 Gateway Timeout
```
🚪 Server Timeout (504): The API server is currently overloaded or temporarily unavailable. 
Please try again in a few minutes, or switch to 'Pro (Black Forest Labs)' model.
```

### Request Timeout
```
⏰ API Timeout: The server is taking too long to respond. 
Please try again in a moment, or consider switching to a different model provider.
```

### Connection Issues
```
🌐 Connection Error: Cannot reach the API server. 
Please check your internet connection and try again.
```

## Recovery Strategies

### For Users:
1. **Wait and Retry**: Server timeouts are often temporary
2. **Switch Providers**: Try "Pro (Black Forest Labs)" instead of "Pro (GRS AI)"
3. **Check Connection**: Verify internet connectivity
4. **Try Later**: Peak usage times may cause overloads

### For Developers:
- Detailed error logs maintained for debugging
- HTTP status codes preserved for analysis
- Request/response details logged for troubleshooting

## Files Modified
- `core/generator.py`: Enhanced `_call_pro_api()` method with comprehensive error handling

## Benefits
- **Better User Experience**: Clear, actionable error messages
- **Reduced Support**: Users know what to do when errors occur
- **Alternative Options**: Automatic suggestions for provider switching
- **Resilient Operation**: Handles temporary API issues gracefully

The app now provides much clearer guidance when API services are experiencing issues, helping users understand what's happening and what they can do about it!
