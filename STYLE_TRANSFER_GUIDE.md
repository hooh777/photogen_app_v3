# Style Transfer Workflow

## Overview

The Style Transfer Workflow implements the pattern: **Selfie (Plain Background) + Style Reference (Scene Background) ‚Üí Stylized Result**

This feature allows users to:
1. Take or use a selfie with a plain/simple background
2. Select a style reference image with an interesting scene/background
3. Generate a stylized result that places the person in the new environment while maintaining their identity

## How It Works

### 1. Selfie Analysis üì∏
- **Person Detection**: Identifies pose, clothing, facial expression, age group
- **Background Analysis**: Determines if background is plain/simple for easy replacement
- **Lighting Analysis**: Extracts current lighting conditions and quality
- **Composition Analysis**: Understands perspective, framing, and focal points

### 2. Style Reference Analysis üé®
- **Scene Description**: Analyzes environment, location type (indoor/outdoor)
- **Color Palette**: Extracts dominant colors and color schemes
- **Lighting Style**: Identifies lighting type, mood, and characteristics
- **Mood & Atmosphere**: Captures emotional tone and style keywords
- **Background Elements**: Catalogs objects, textures, patterns, architectural features

### 3. Intelligent Prompt Generation ‚úçÔ∏è
- Combines person characteristics from selfie with style elements from reference
- Preserves identity, pose, and clothing while applying new background and lighting
- Includes technical quality instructions for photorealistic results
- Generates optimized prompts for seamless integration

## Usage Options

### 1. Command Line Interface

#### Basic Usage
```bash
python scripts/style_transfer_workflow.py selfie.jpg style_reference.jpg
```

#### Analysis Only (No Generation)
```bash

```

#### Custom Output Directory
```bash
python scripts/style_transfer_workflow.py selfie.jpg style_reference.jpg --output-dir "my_results"
```

#### Save Analysis Files
```bash
python scripts/style_transfer_workflow.py selfie.jpg style_reference.jpg --analyze-only --save-analyses
```

#### Setup API Key
```bash
python scripts/style_transfer_workflow.py --setup-key
```

### 2. Graphical User Interface

```bash
python scripts/style_transfer_gui.py
```

The GUI provides:
- Easy file selection for selfie and style reference
- Options for analysis-only mode
- Custom output directory selection
- Real-time progress indicators
- Detailed results display
- API key setup interface

### 3. Demo Script

```bash
python scripts/style_transfer_demo.py
```

```bash
python scripts/style_transfer_demo.py --technical
```

## Example Workflows

### üåÖ Beach Sunset Style
- **Input**: Selfie with plain white wall background
- **Style**: Beach sunset with warm orange/pink lighting
- **Result**: Person in same pose but with beach sunset background and matching warm lighting

### üå≤ Forest Adventure Style
- **Input**: Selfie with plain background
- **Style**: Dense forest with dappled sunlight
- **Result**: Person appears to be in the forest with natural lighting filtering through trees

### üèôÔ∏è City Night Style
- **Input**: Selfie with simple background
- **Style**: City skyline at night with neon lights
- **Result**: Person with urban nighttime atmosphere and colorful city lights reflecting on them

## Technical Implementation

### Core Components

#### StyleTransferProcessor Class
- `analyze_selfie()`: Comprehensive selfie analysis
- `analyze_style_reference()`: Style reference analysis
- `generate_style_transfer_prompt()`: Intelligent prompt generation
- `process_style_transfer_workflow()`: Complete workflow execution

#### Key Features
- **Vision Analysis Integration**: Uses Qwen-VL-Max for comprehensive scene understanding
- **Structured Data Extraction**: Parses vision responses into organized categories
- **Intelligent Prompt Engineering**: Combines elements for optimal generation results
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Tracks entire workflow with detailed JSON logs
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling with informative messages

### Analysis Categories

#### Person Details (from Selfie)
- Appearance and physical characteristics
- Pose and body language
- Clothing and accessories
- Facial expression and emotion
- Age group and gender (when relevant)

#### Background Information (from Selfie)
- Background type and complexity
- Whether background is plain/simple
- Colors and lighting in background
- Suitability for replacement

#### Scene Description (from Style Reference)
- Environment and location type
- Indoor vs outdoor setting
- Architectural and natural elements
- Overall scene composition

#### Style Elements (from Style Reference)
- Color palette and schemes
- Lighting style and direction
- Mood and atmospheric qualities
- Textures and patterns
- Visual style characteristics

## Best Practices

### Choosing Selfies
- **Plain Backgrounds Work Best**: Solid colors, simple walls, minimal patterns
- **Good Lighting**: Even lighting without harsh shadows
- **Clear Subject**: Person should be the main focus
- **Standard Poses**: Natural poses work better than complex positions

### Choosing Style References
- **Interesting Environments**: Scenic locations, atmospheric settings
- **Good Composition**: Well-composed scenes with clear background elements
- **Appropriate Lighting**: Lighting that could realistically illuminate a person
- **High Quality**: Clear, detailed images produce better style extraction

### Optimization Tips
- Use high-resolution images when possible
- Ensure good contrast between person and background in selfie
- Choose style references with lighting that matches desired mood
- Review analysis results before generation to understand extracted elements

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "No API key configured"
```bash
python scripts/style_transfer_workflow.py --setup-key
```

#### "Image not found" or "Unsupported format"
- Check file paths are correct
- Ensure images are in supported formats: .jpg, .jpeg, .png, .webp, .bmp, .tiff

#### Poor analysis results
- Try images with better lighting
- Use higher resolution images
- Ensure clear subject separation from background

#### Generation issues
- Review generated prompt for accuracy
- Try different style reference images
- Check that API key has sufficient credits

### Getting Help

1. **Run Demo**: `python scripts/style_transfer_demo.py` for concept explanation
2. **Check Logs**: Review JSON log files in outputs directory
3. **Analysis Mode**: Use `--analyze-only` to test without generation
4. **Verbose Output**: Check console output for detailed processing information

## Integration

The style transfer workflow can be integrated into other applications:

```python
from core.style_transfer import StyleTransferProcessor

processor = StyleTransferProcessor()

# Analyze images
selfie_analysis = processor.analyze_selfie("path/to/selfie.jpg")
style_analysis = processor.analyze_style_reference("path/to/style.jpg")

# Generate prompt
prompt = processor.generate_style_transfer_prompt(selfie_analysis, style_analysis)

# Run complete workflow
results = processor.process_style_transfer_workflow(
    "path/to/selfie.jpg",
    "path/to/style.jpg",
    "output_directory"
)
```

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for the style transfer workflow:

1. **Background Segmentation**: Automatic person/background separation
2. **Lighting Adjustment**: Automatic lighting correction to match style
3. **Multi-Person Support**: Handle group selfies with multiple people
4. **Style Strength Control**: Adjustable intensity of style application
5. **Real-time Preview**: Quick preview generation before full resolution
6. **Batch Processing**: Process multiple selfies with same style reference
7. **Style Mixing**: Combine multiple style references
