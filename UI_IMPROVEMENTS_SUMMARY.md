# PhotoGen App UI Improvements Summary

## Changes Implemented ✅

### 1. Increased Canvas Size
- **File:** `core/ui.py`
- **Change:** Interactive canvas height increased from 400px to 600px
- **Impact:** Better visibility and easier interaction with uploaded images
- **Code:** `height=600` in interactive canvas component

### 2. Changed Default Model Selection  
- **File:** `core/ui.py`
- **Change:** Default model selection changed to "Pro (GRS AI)"
- **Impact:** Users start with the preferred Pro model by default
- **Code:** `value="Pro (GRS AI)"` in model dropdown

### 3. Removed Unused "Number of Images" Slider
- **File:** `core/ui.py`
- **Change:** Completely removed the `num_images` slider component
- **Impact:** Simplified UI, removed confusing unused control
- **Rationale:** Code analysis revealed `num_images` is hardcoded to 1 in `generation_manager.py`

### 4. Streamlined Save/Download Buttons
- **Files:** `core/ui.py`, `app.py`
- **Change:** Replaced separate "Save to Gallery" and "Download" buttons with single "Download Result" button
- **Impact:** Simplified workflow - one click saves and downloads the latest generated image
- **Behavior:** Automatically saves and immediately starts download of the most recent image
