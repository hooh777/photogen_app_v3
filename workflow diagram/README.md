### ✅ What You Now Have

#### **Strategic Level Documentation**
- **C4 Context**: Perfect for explaining PhotoGen to non-technical stakeholders
- **C4 Container**: Ideal for technical architecture discussions and technology choices

#### **Tactical Level Documentation**  
- **Component Diagram**: Detailed component interactions and responsibilities
- **Simplified State Diagram**: Essential states without overwhelming detail

#### **Implementation Level Documentation**
- **Class Diagram**: Complete code structure (serves as C4 Level 4)
- **Sequence Diagram**: Dynamic behavior and API interaction patterns
- **Data Flow Diagram**: Information processing and transformation flows

### ❌ What Was Removed/Consolidated

1. **API Integration Detailed** → Information distributed across C4 levels
2. **Complex State Diagram** → Simplified to focus on key user-impacting states  
3. **Deployment Diagram** → Replaced by C4 Context showing external dependencies

### 🎯 Usage Guidelines by Audience

#### **For Business Meetings**
- Use: C4 Context Diagram
- Shows: How PhotoGen fits in the AI content creation ecosystem
- Explains: Value proposition and external service dependencies

#### **For Technical Architecture Reviews**  
- Use: C4 Container + Component Diagrams
- Shows: Technical stack, container responsibilities, data flow
- Explains: Scalability, technology choices, integration points

#### **For Development Planning**
- Use: Class + Sequence Diagrams  
- Shows: Code structure, method signatures, interaction patterns
- Explains: Implementation details, API call sequences

#### **For System Analysis**
- Use: State + Data Flow Diagrams
- Shows: Application behavior, data transformations
- Explains: User workflows, error handling, state transitions

#### **For Onboarding New Developers**
- Start with: C4 Context → C4 Container → Component Diagram → Class Diagram
- Progressive detail: Business context → Architecture → Components → Code

### 🔧 Maintenance Strategy

1. **C4 Context/Container**: Update when adding new external services or major architecture changes
2. **Component Diagram**: Update when adding new managers or changing component responsibilities  
3. **Class Diagram**: Keep synchronized with code changes (most frequently updated)
4. **Sequence Diagram**: Update when API interactions or workflows change
5. **State Diagram**: Update when adding new user modes or major state changes
6. **Data Flow**: Update when data processing logic or storage patterns change

### 📊 Documentation Coverage Map

| System Aspect | Primary Diagram | Secondary Diagrams |
|---------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **Business Context** | C4 Context | - |
| **Technical Architecture** | C4 Container | Component |
